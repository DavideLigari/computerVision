# License Plate Detection and Recognition

A computer vision project that focuses on the detection and recognition of license plates in images. This system is designed to locate license plates in images, extract the characters from the plates, and convert them into digital text.

## Project Overview

The project involves several key steps:

1. **Dataset Preparation**: Collect a dataset of images containing vehicles with visible license plates and annotate the license plate regions.

2. **Preprocessing**: Enhance image quality through techniques like histogram equalization.

3. **Canny Edge Detection**: Identify strong edges in the preprocessed images.

4. **Hough Transform for Plate Detection**: Detect potential rectangular regions in the images that could be license plates.

5. **Region of Interest (ROI) Selection**: Narrow down the search area based on the detected lines and select the region where the license plate is located.

6. **Erosion and Dilation for Text Enhancement**: Apply erosion and dilation to enhance the text features on the license plate.

7. **Filters for Improved Plate Clarity**: Utilize filters like Sobel to further enhance the edges and characters on the license plate.

8. **Character Segmentation**: Implement morphological algorithms for character segmentation within the license plate region.

9. **Character Recognition**: Use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to recognize and extract characters from the segmented regions.

10. **Post-processing and Verification**: Verify the recognized characters, correct errors, and format the characters if necessary.
